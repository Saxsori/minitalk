## A communication program in the form of a client and a server.

âž¥ The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.

âž¥ Once the string has been received, the server must print it.

âž¥ The communication between client and server has to be done only using UNIX signals.

âž¥ Only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

### Bonus

âž¥ The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client.

âž¥ Unicode characters support!
