## A communication program in the form of a client and a server.

➥ The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.

➥ Once the string has been received, the server must print it.

➥ The communication between client and server has to be done only using UNIX signals.

➥ Only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.

### Bonus

➥ The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client.

➥ Unicode characters support!
